The game was widely accepted and is still in massive demand. So how to get started?","Instal Apex Legends Mobile Android app and get done with identification, terms acceptance and login method. In your default settings, choose your experience level from 'No experience in mobile shooting games (Auto-Firing will be enabled)' or 'Experienced in mobile shooting Games'. You may then customize your layout and go in for a tutorial. You'll get to know about the moves, basic functionalities and features this way. Once acquainted with it, you can register as a legend and create a username. Legends are unique characters with specific personality traits and distinct origins. You'll know more about the legends slowly as you progress into the game. Pick a few of your choice and experiment with them. Identify the one that suits you. To figure out the same, begin with the offensive and defensive ones before trying out the high-utility legends. Know clearly about the legends and their hitboxes. Hitbox denotes the probability of your legend getting shot. Larger the hitbox, the larger the chance. ","If you are a newbie, we've listed a few things that would get you going smoothly in the first few matches without getting you into much trouble. The first goal to be kept in mind is to land more quickly than the others. Ensure that the enemies don't find you in those initial moments when your team is underequipped. Once you get to the ground, the first thing you'll be doing is collecting the loot items scattered around. Always be on the move and avoid loitering in the same area. Use the sliding mechanic to improve your speed and movements. A combination of jumping and sliding helps to move faster. Turn on auto-pickup to collect all the items without losing much time. Know what the colours of the loots mean- white would be a  common article, blue is a rare loot, purple is an epic one, and gold must be something legendary. Collect them all and sort them when you are in safety. Collecting weapons, especially guns that match your playstyle is the key. Each legend will have a unique playstyle and yours is \n            not an exception. While collecting these weapons, keep in mind to find those that fit various encounters- indoors, outdoors, etc. \n            This is a team game and communication with your teammates should help! If you have found something rare or worthwhile, let them know. Always stay close to them and tell them if you intend to go somewhere.  That way, you'll have the combined abilities of your squadmates and have a higher possibility of defeating your opponent. Revive your fallen teammates and respawn them You'll get to a downed state when your health is drained. You can resurrect your teammate in this state before the enemy uses a finisher upon them. Even though it is a risky move, it is well worth it.  Collect shields and use them. Remember, there is an encroaching ring coming near you. You must therefore survive both that and your opponents. Coming to opponents, eliminate and finish them off without mercy. Do not forget to loot fallen enemies. If you find something significant, you can call out your teammates and give them the item locations of worthwhile objects. You'll never know what comes in handy and when. So, do not take anything lightly.","Know the arena you are playing in to make decisions faster and manoeuvre more effectively.
