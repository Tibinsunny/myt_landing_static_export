And if you've been a gamer residing on planet earth, this game wouldn't be new to you. If you are not, that's not a problem at all, we'll get you covered. Pokemon Unite, dear alien friend(s) is a widely played augmented reality game developed by a company called Niantic. (If you haven't noticed,'Niantic' could have been an anagram for 'Titanic' if it had 'T' instead of its first 'N'. But then, you'd want us to explain what 'Titanic' is, so never mind.). The game runs on both ios and android with a very large fan base to make it a global phenomenon. The app is free to download but would require location and camera permission and includes in-app purchases. You can play the game with real people (and real aliens) in real time. This means you can play with other living beings from different places. Now, let's get on to the things that make this game more interesting.","Firstly, Pokemon Unite is very simple to learn. Players who are new to this could get the strategies quite easily and it is really fun! The game has a set time limit of ten minutes to make it crisp and engaging. You can also opt for a shorter and more engaging 5 minutes time limit. You see, there is always this last-minute comeback possible and one can strive for it. Your team must score more points than your opposite team before time runs out. Points can be scored by capturing wild pokemon and dunking them into goals in enemy territory. The game is quite similar to League of Legends. You'd arrive at the difference if you subtract its complexity and add speed to it. The gameplay is simpler, different and guarantees a great experience. In short, you do not have to be good at other MOBA games to excel in Pokemon Unite.","Secondly, it is a multiplayer game which you can play with your friends, or make new ones by playing with people around the globe or even, play with strangers without having to make them friends(If you do not feel like socializing). The number of members in a team can be chosen. Currently, 5v5, 4v4, and 3v3 are the available modes. You can enjoy the game to the fullest by playing it with a switch pro controller or with switch joycons in controller position.","Thirdly, You can rank up in Pokemon Unite and the ranking is worldwide! Admit it, that's a great incentive to play on. You'd also get rewards like items for your pokemon, pokemon licenses, and apparel for your trainer. Items can also be found in the Item Store. You can get them either through tokens or gems.","To make it more real-like, certain maps and game modes are gated behind trainer levels as well. There is one standard map and three quick-match maps. For standard and ranked battles, Remoat Stadium is the map used and Mer Stadium, Shivre City, and Auroma Park are for quick matches. The available quick match map rotates regularly.","In a nutshell, you have to select the moves for your Pokemon and build advantage as it evolves. Develop your own strategy by watching your opponents and choosing moves that counter it. Focus on escalating danger. You can score more if you stay on in the game. Losing your lane isn't the end. You always have the possibility to turn the game around when you level up. There isn't much rocket science to this game. You'll get the hang of it if you try it once.\xa0Go,\xa0Gamer!",],howToDownload:null,howToPlay:null};return(0,n.jsxs)("div",{children:[(0,n.jsxs)(r(),{children:[(0,n.jsxs)("title",{children:[e.title," - My Tournament"]}),(0,n.jsx)("meta",{name:"description",content:"My Tournament Home Page"}),(0,n.jsx)("link",{rel:"icon",href:"/favicon.ico"})]}),(0,n.jsx)(o.Z,{bannerImage:A,logo:i.Z,data:e})]})}},426:function(e){e.exports={gameAbout:"gameAbout_gameAbout__oFDya",About:"gameAbout_About__PhwpH",aboutHeading:"gameAbout_aboutHeading__oKEo1",aboutDesc:"gameAbout_aboutDesc__MhyOz",banner:"gameAbout_banner__Rx2_5",logoContainer:"gameAbout_logoContainer__T60GT",bannerImage:"gameAbout_bannerImage__YnAV2",bannerGradient1:"gameAbout_bannerGradient1__Vm9sm",bannerGradient2:"gameAbout_bannerGradient2__bFJLH"}}},function(e){e.O(0,[320,774,888,179],function(){return e(e.s=7638)}),_N_E=e.O()}]);
